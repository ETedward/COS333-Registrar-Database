Contributions:

Edward: Edward worked on the UI interfaces displaying the line-edits,  
widgets and textboxes to the GUI interface. Edward connected the
assignment1 regdetails code with the assignment2 code. Edward handled the
pop up messages for double clicks and enters for further details. Also 
worked on the regserver code through peer programming with Bharat.

Bharat: Also worked on the UI interface in structuring a display that 
matches the assignment specifications. Bharat implemented a function 
that handles the correct regdetails output into the message box. Bharat
spearheaded the majority of the regserver code and the server / socket
handling. Together, we also worked to modularize our code and fix 
several bugs from the previous assignment part.

What authorized sources of information and did you use for the assignment?

1) The course's lectures, and precept notes. 
2) Scanned through Piazza posts for key insights.
3) Professor Dondero answered our questions through the instructor email.
4) Jace helped us during his Saturday office hours.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assignment Process:

We spent around 10 hours on the assignment. It was helpful and useful.
We particularly enjoyed the UI design sections and seeing our work from
part one being displayed. The server handling was more tedious, but still
educational.
