Contributions:

Edward worked to debug the assignment 2 code ahead of time.

Then we engaged in a long session of peer programming together, rewatching 
the lecture slides on threading, and progressing step by step through the 
different iterations of Penny and equivalents in our code. We helped each 
other with bugs and worked together to finally arrive at Penny5, and an 
equivalent Reg.py!

What authorized sources of information and did you use for the assignment?

1) Preceptor Jeffery Li helped us debug our assignment 2 code
2) Scanned through Piazza posts for key insights.
3) Followed the lectures on threads, and referenced the Penny.py code.

Assignment Process:

We spent around 5 hours on the assignment. It wasn't too bad!
